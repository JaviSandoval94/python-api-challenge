# Introduction
Ever wondered how to plan your ideal vacation? This project will help you make plans to visit your ideal destination based on data retrieved from API calls using Python!
The project consists of two Jupyter Notebooks called `WeatherPy.ipynb` and `VacationPy.ipynb`. On these files, you will find the code to:
1. Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data from different locations around the world and filter them according to your preferences of temperature, cloudiness and wind.
2. Use the Google Maps API to find accommodation in your prefered sites. <br>
The results are displayed in world maps to ensure your best travel experience!

# Data set
The code is done using API calls from:
[OpenWeather API](https://rapidapi.com/blog/lp/openweathermap/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Beta_99804720366&utm_term=%2Bopenweathermap_b&gclid=CjwKCAjwkdL6BRAREiwA-kiczJRACM76pQ2N-s9VaM59_FxV2vMtJClhaGrA_9b5MAxoMyaK6OMYnBoCrpwQAvD_BwE)

# Code explanation
You will have to download both the `WeatherPy.ipynb` and `VacationPy.ipynb` to run the code, as well as input your API parameters in the code to perform the requests. Make sure to install the corresponding libraries. You can modify the parameters of cloudiness, wind speed, and temperature in the `WeatherPy.ipynb` file to adjust to your preferences and plan your ideal vacation.
